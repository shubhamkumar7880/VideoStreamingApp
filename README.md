This a youtube cloen app made using react.js and tailwind css. I am using youtube's live api for getting videos on the homepage. I have also made a watch page where that particular video will be played. Also made a search bar that show suggesting and also storing those suggestions in the cache to reduce api calls. Also I implemented debouncing logic in that search bar witha gap of 200ms per word for performace optimization. Also, we are using Redux Toolkit in this app for data management. Also, I will add more features in this app in future.

To see the code, go to master branch.
